I had this all planned out when I ordered new keycaps from TaoBao but didn’t really had the time when the caps arrived. My QFR is already 4 years old and the top case and keys have seen much better days but the Cherry MX switches all still work fine though. My previous posts will show the condition of the top case if you guys would like to see. </p>
<p>Before I begin with the steps I took to paint my case, I would like to note that I am not preaching this as the only and perfect method. You are free to check other methods from other websites or youtube. With my experience with painting cars (no I do not paint it but I get to talk and work with some car painters) I tried to follow some methods used in car painting. </p>
<p>Another thing before I start with the steps. Please make sure to check on how to open up your mechanical keyboard since every keyboard is different. This will also void the warranty for your keyboard if it is still inside warranty. So only do this when you are sure you want to give up the warranty for your board. </p>
<p>If you want the specific steps go jump near the end of the post.</p>
<p>So here is my weapon of choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>400 grit sandpaper</li>
<li>600 grit sandpaper</li>
<li>1000 grit sandpaper</li>
<li>Plastic paint primer</li>
<li>Color paint</li>
<li>Top coat</li>
</ul>
<p>So for this job I went with a base color instead of a plastic primer. Normally I would go with a plastic primer but it was hard to find one in my area, so I went ahead and got a flat white paint. The description says its a paint+primer which means this does not need any primer before application + I can use this as a base coat before I apply the main color that I want. I chose Samurai as my color paint and top coat because it was cheap and that is the only brand in my area that has the blue shade that I was looking for and it was also the only brand that had clear matte top coat.</p>
<p>When painting anything one of the things you will learn is that paint is only as good as your preparation. Do not hurry up things and do not cut corners if you don’t have to. </p>
<p>Here are samples of how it looks like after coats</p>
<img src="/images/qfrrepaint.jpg" class="">

<p>Here are the steps I performed for this job</p>
<p>Note Please make sure to put masking tap on the inside part of the case making sure to cover up the tabs and the side. If not it will be hard for you to fit the top cover back to the base since the side will accumulate paint.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dismantle the top cover</li>
<li>Wet sanded the top cover using 400 grit sandpaper. Careful not too put too much pressure. You want to make sure that the plastic does not get deformed.</li>
<li>Finished off sanding using 600 grit sandpaper again wet sand</li>
<li>Let is dry for 30 mins</li>
<li>Applied base coat/primer. I did this by applying thin coats making sure everything gets painted in every pass. I did 3 layers with 10-15 mins interval for each pass (the time really depends on the paint you are using). Let it dry</li>
<li>Wet sanded the cover using 1000 grit sandpaper to smoothen the texture and make sure there are no uneven paint</li>
<li>Let it dry for 30 mins</li>
<li>Applied the color paint. I did 4 layers with 15-20 mins interval for each pass (my paint can says it should be 30 mins interval). Make sure each pass covers everything including the corners.  Let it dry.</li>
<li>Again I wet sanded with 1000 grit sandpaper after the 2nd coat and then proceeded with the 3rd and 4th coats.</li>
<li>Applied top coat clear matt. I did 4 layers with 20-30 mins interval (this time I followed instructions from the paint can). I did thin to medium layers with fast strokes because I wanted to achieve a textured matt finish. </li>
<li>After the 4th layer of top coat. I let it dry for 2 days without touching it.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Again this is my method and I hope it works for you. I posted photos of the results and if they are satisfactory for you then you can follow the steps that I did.</p>

I really wanted to try a different kind of mechanical keyboard switch and at the same time have some RGB colors on it. With the lack of funds at the moment I opted for a cheap Chinese brand keyboard. </p>
<p>There are a lot of mechanical keyboards on sale in TaoBao. You can even see the brands being sold from Massdrop. I normally use TKL keyboards and there not much to choose from in this category atleast during the time when I was buying mine. What I did was get the brand and tried to find a review of some sort on youtube You will be surprised how many people use cheap mechanical keyboards nowadays. Probably one of the reason is because Cherry lost their patent on their mechanical switches and that means party time for Chinese copycats. As of this writing I believe there are a few mechanical switches available from China: Kailh, Gateron, Otemu are among the famous one’s.</p>
<img src="/images/fuhlen.jpg" class="">

<p>I did find a lot and at the end I settled for this Fühlen SM680R TKL Full RGB keyboard. It comes with Kailh Blue switches which from what I gather are copies of Cherry MX blues. It is full RGB with 9 RGB modes (oh yes). The package is shown below when opened. It only comes with a red keycap remover and a manual which is in Chinese so I have no use for it. </p>
<p>It’s almost as heavy as my non rgb CM storm. The button feels good and are very clicky clacky clack clack. The keycaps as expected is no up to par with most of the known brands but for  the price I cannot really complain. I just feel that it is somewhat soft when pressed, maybe because I got used to my Cherry MX black switches. Typing on this keyboard is really a nice experience the clicks are pronounced. It is a whole new experience for me coming from black cherry mx switches. I now understand why people like blue switches.</p>
<p>The usb cable is not detachable which is ok but it is braded with one end of the velco cable unremovable. Which is nice if you like to keep your cables organized and you don’t have to worry about losing it </p>
<p>The only gripe I have with this keyboard is legends not sure what they wanted to achieve from it but it does not look like its more for gaming but then again like I said previously I can’t really complain because of the price. </p>
<p>The mode I use the most is the mode where you set the specific color you want to use for each key. It is quick nice if you play in the dark. I do not really use the moving lights modes as I am afraid it might cause the LED’s life to deteriorate. </p>
<p>All in all I am happy with the purchase. I was supposed to use my CM Storm Quickfire for office and keep the Fuhlen keyboard for home use. I ended up doing it the other way around since it was much more nicer to type on blue switches plus I can show off at the office and annoy people with the clicky clack clack clack click sound.</p>
<p>I do not know how long the keyboard will last before something breaks but definitely I will have it posted here when it breaks down. The local seller did give me lifetime warranty on the switches so that is all good. </p>

I told them no was home and everyone was at work. I asked the guy if he can comeback tomorrow and he said “tah boleh” which is the local term for cannot. I was also pretty hard to communicate with him (I think the feeling is mutual). Eventually he started saying the word “gate” which I guessed he meant was leaving the package inside the gate by throwing it inside. Since I have no other choice as I am bound to work for the next 5 days for 12 hours each day including weekends, I told him yes please throw it inside and I proceeded to give him my ID. If something broke or something was missing i’de be in deepshit.</p>
<p>The mess when I was unpacking and getting ready to try on the keycaps</p>
<img src="/images/keycapgalore.jpg" class="">

<p>So enough of the story. With my previous posts I have mentioned that I ordered quite a number of keycaps from Taobao. I wasn’t really expecting too much since the price was way below compared to branded and known companies but the price was still way above my budget but you know how it is. I got 3 sets of TKL and 1 set RGB.</p>
<p>This is how the packaging looks like and what was inside</p>

<p>So let me go through each one of them.</p>
<p>First off the one advertised as PBT and was the most expensive of the set. Looking at how it look like when I took if off the white box, it seems like the common keycaps you see on youtube being reviewed by people and got them off taobao as well. Of all the keycaps I ordered I like this the most for my CM Storm Quickfire Rapid. One because it was really PBT see photo comparison below. Two it was for non backlit keyboard and I did like the color scheme it came with. </p>
<center><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="ZC7AOpo"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//imgur.com/ZC7AOpo">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Check the cap comparison below. The black caps is the OEM keycaps that came with my CM Storm Quickfire Rapid and the one below is the one I ordered</p>
<center><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="iRHYIyf"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//imgur.com/iRHYIyf">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Next set would be the unprinted RGB keycaps for shit, alt, ctrl, windows and fn keys. It included the esc key which was printed. It was advertised as PBT and unfortunately I was not able to take a photo but it was more thicker than my oem and almost close to the first set I showed. </p>
<center><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="K0Niua9"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//imgur.com/K0Niua9">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>Off to the backlits</p>
<center><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="R4l6KcA"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//imgur.com/R4l6KcA">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>3rd set I got was this backlit White/Gray/Red combination. This one I am quite disappointed because the keycaps was just really ABS but was advertised as PBT and was almost close to how thick my oem CM Storm keycaps were. On the good side it came with extra keys, 2 keycap pullers, 3 escape keys. The legends on this one is also much better than the other backlit keyboard that I got, well considering the price it was more expensive than the other one. </p>
<center><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="UQwJYCp"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//imgur.com/UQwJYCp">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>This is the complete set TKL keys with the extras</p>
<center><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="nvoDDfc"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//imgur.com/nvoDDfc">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>A more closer look at the extras</p>
<center><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="bdXcTsV"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//imgur.com/bdXcTsV">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>4th and last set is this orange,grey,white set. Just like the first backlit set I posted the quality is the same with the oem caps like abs and quite thin. This set also does not come with any extras just the key puller. The legends was also not that good in my opinion (it might be good for others). </p>
<center><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="feNYEpK"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//imgur.com/feNYEpK">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>All in all I am happy with what I got for the price I paid. I believe the cost of all the keycaps is not even enough for 1 geekhack, SA, WASD keycap set. If you need the link for the original PBT keycaps please leave a comment with your email and I will provide you the link. </p>

<p>Photo above shows my daily warrior for work and home use. It has gone throught a lot but still working as good as the first time I bought it. The keyboard is probably almost 3 years odl already and the body of the thing is showing up the scars from the daily abuse. Normally what I would do is sell the thing off and get a new one. I can’t let this go for some reason. </p>
<p>Lately I have been shopping for a cheap rgb keyboard and I bought one cheap chinese brand from a local seller from where I am. Quality seems ok. I will some details about it in a bit.</p>
<center><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="WLa24Bv"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//imgur.com/WLa24Bv">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>During the process of looking for a new keyboard, I found some affordable keycaps (let’s face it geekhack.com, deskthority.net and even Massdrop keycaps ain’t really the cheapest ones you can find). I found a few tidbits in TaoBao and has asked a middleman service to order them for me. Hopefully I can get them in the next couple fo weeks. </p>
<p>I am not sure if I ordered caps for none-backlit keyboard (this CM Storm TKL) only or if its for backlit keyboards I ain’t chinese. It was advertised as PBT which should be somewhat a bit better than regular ABS keycaps that come with most keyboards being sold in the market. I ordered couple of color sets and a RGB set for my modifiers. </p>
<center><blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="lPkCNMR"><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="//imgur.com/lPkCNMR">View post on imgur.com</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

<p>I plan to give new life to my old CM Storm once the keycaps arrive. I am still deciding if I will sticker bomb the cover or paint it all out completely with a certain shade of color. I might do the latter. I still need to figure out how to open this thing up though since it is still a virgin and I have not tried opening it up yet. This will give me time to completely clean up the whole thing from the inside and hopefully if I can learn how to do it is to lube the switches (Cherry MX blacks ain’t really the softest of the switches)</p>
<p>Now I am really excited on getting those keycaps. Hopefully they arrive soon.</p>

<p>Last month I decided to upgrade my Dell laptop to Linux Mint 18 (Sarah) from Linux Mint 17.3. I have been using linux mint as a daily driver for that laptop and so far I have no issues with it until after upgrading to linux mint 18. </p>
<p>The fans on my laptop kept running at full speed even if its idle. A quick google search and I found out that I am not the only one having the issue. It does seem like it is a common issue with Dell laptops not just the model that I own and it is not specific with linux mint as well. </p>
<p>I did try to configure a lot of things including changing settings in acpi to linux but that did not seem to help. I found out about i8kutils during the process but after installing it, the fans just stopped working for a few seconds then went back to it’s merry own way of running at full speed. </p>
<p>Installing lm-sensors (sudo apt-get install lm-sensors) did not show that it detected any fans on my system (an update to this after a kernel upgrade provided by linux mint, running lm-sensors now show that it detects a fan and shows the fan speed) even though you can hear the fan physicall running. </p>
<p>Please watch the video below on how I fixed the issue for my machine. It might or might not work for you but it is worth a try anyway. This might also work for other Dell laptops not just the model that I have. If it does work for you please leave a comment here or on my youtube video and please state the dell laptop model you used it on to help other people.</p>

<p>I started out my linux adventures via slackware linux. Now I am using the easiest way out Linux Mint just because I am getting old and when you get old there are a lot of things you best spend your time on. Back then everyone was playing with their redhat and I insisted that I wanted something out of the box. I still remember my happy mother when I ask her to buy me a book that was so thick and was quite expensive. It was a Linux for dummies book because I wanted to learn how to use the operating system and internet back then was a real pain in the ass. Google was not yet conceived so there was really not much for me to get  the information from.</p>
<p>When I started with slackware I can still remember the 2 drives that died on me during the process for installing, removing, re-installing, partition, re-partition but I did learn a few bits here and there. Back then linux package management was not yet the thing. You have to download and compile including the dependencies for a program to be installed in slackware. </p>
<p>Fast forward this year, I got bored and said to myself that I really want to try and learn a fair bit of BSD. So I downloaded the iso and for testing purposes installed it in a virtual machine (thank God for the people who created those things). Yep it was a pain but using it brings back the slackware days during my younger years. Make, make install, tar etc etc. It’s only now that I understood what it meant by slackware is most unix like linux distro. So I guess having experience with slackware did help me with playing around with BSD. </p>
<p>I did have some old hardware I was planning to use BSD on and use the machine as my home server but unfortunately life is hard nowadays and I don’t really have the extra means to buy western digital red nas drives. Maybe in time I can learn more about bsd and the infamous file system they are using and be able to apply it on my home server but for now I will play around with it inside the virtual box. I might be able to score some cheap 250gb hdd soon and use that as my main bsd drive and dual boot the desktop. </p>
<p>For people who want to venture into BSD, I would suggest you read up the Freebsd manual its really quite good and has a lot of information. Let’s face it if you have no experience with BSD the first thing that will come to your mind would be FreeBSD. Be prepared for the unlimited headache you will get though, chances are some of your hardware requires a lot of configuring to do. Some of your linux application might not have been ported to FreeBSD. You might need to compile one on your own.</p>

I need to free up space in my room since I am sharing it with my girlfriend. Another factor is its pretty hard to find food for them, at least where I live. </p>
<p>Tarantulas are really not hard to take care of and their up keep is really cheap. Initial cost might be high for the terrarium and cocopeat and stuff but there are cheaper plastic alternatives you can use.</p>
<p>Once they are inside their terrariums, all you need to make sure is they have water in the water dish and feed them. They do not really eat too much since they do not move a lot their metabolism is quite slow. Tarantulas are also known to go on for days without food. Perfect example is my Grammostola Rosea which only eats once a month. If you check in google, this is not an unusual behavior for these species.</p>
<p>The only issue I have with their food is that meal worms, crickets, roaches is really hard to find from where I am at. I of course do not want to take care of a colony since I live in a condominium (imagine having a colony of crickets in your condominium balcony, I am pretty sure every neighbor that you have will go and complain to the building admin). When I do get the time to buy crickets or meal worm, the rest of them just die before I feed my T’s again since they do not really eat everyday and I only have 3 of them.</p>
<p>Well I hope I can find someone to adopt them and take care of them. The G. Rosea I will miss the most since she is pretty docile and she is the only one I can really handle without having to be afraid that she might be me.</p>

I check speed and fan and my processor was burning. So I turned off my desktop and quickly checked inside bios and found out that the pump was not reporting any activity. I switched the pump fan header to a different fan header on my system board and turned on the machine. Result = SAME</p>
<p>My tower before the pump died</p>
<img src="/images/pc_before.jpg" class="">

<p>So I took out the OEM Intel fan that I had and quickly installed it hoping I would get the same result (hoping that the AIO pump was not dead) but viola the system temps were back to normal. So as it stand my Deepcool gamerstorm 240MM AIO pump is dead. The fans run but the stupid pump is dead. </p>
<img src="/images/pc_no_cooler.jpg" class="">

<p>Oh well the system is now back up to normal using the original OEM Intel fan. I am thinking of keeping it this way for a bit since I am due for a system upgrade soon and I only usually do light gaming on the desktop anyways (Dota 2) and thats about it. I mostly use it for torrents and watching movies on my TV.</p>
<img src="/images/pc_oem_cooler.jpg" class="">

<p>Damn deepcool it’s so sad to see it die but you can’t have it all. I’m going to include it on the desktop set that I am selling (Intel E7400, 4gb corsair ram, Asus P5Q SE Plus, Coolermaster PSU and a broken 9800 GT) Hope someone buys it and I am going to use the money to buy WD NAS Reds.</p>
<p>RIP Deepcool</p>
