<p>I am really starting to love this SA profile.. It is now installed in my CM Quickfire Rapid with MX Blacks and the switches now feel much better and is softer compare to using cherry or oem profile. Maybe the added size and weight of the caps does help. I will be making another post with photos of the keys installed on the keyboard. </p>
<p>I’ve had to mix and match the add-ons, man the struggle is real when you have 2 different add-ons to choose from but I am loving it and I am loving the sound of my keyboard now with and without the stand off feet.</p>
<p>My only gripe with the TKL base set is that it does not come with any default homing keys, not that it matters since I got used to type touching and my fingers find the F/J keys automatically but here are times they tend to look for the bump. I just didn’t want to spend the extra cash on the homing keys addon since I just be using 2 keys from it and everything else will be unused.</p>

That means I am playing steam from Linux (well at least the natively supported games for linux)</p>
<p>Recently I posted the new Dota 2 7.00 patch… a very big patch from Valve which kinda changed the game a whole lot…. that includes support for certain file systems (I guess).. I was running dual boot windows 10 and linux on my desktop before I decided to delete the windows partition since I find myself always using Linux instead and I am not as young as before in a sense that I do not play a lot of computer games anymore.. I do have my playstation 4 for the casual NBA 2k gaming though. So I had a data drive where my steam directory is stored since I am running my OS on a SSD drive and it doesn’t really have too much space. This drive is an NTFS partition drive since I was using it with windows previous and never bothered to change it since I am able to read/write on the drive without any issues. Another reason I did not change is because, since it is my data drive I can always remove it and connect it to another machine (most probably running windows) and it will be recognized by that machine without any issues.</p>
<p>Going back to the problem…. the update will not finish and will always give me an error about “Corrupt Data Files” I tried several fixes including removing the whole game itself and tried reinstalling it but was still having the same error.</p>
<p>What I did was I removed the game and reinstall it but this time I chose to install it on my Linux OS drive which is using ext4 file system. It installed just fine and ran without any issues. Now I am not sure if this is a limitation put in by Valve or they made a mistake since running the game from a NTFS partition worked just fine before.</p>
<p>Until I read any updates on this I will be running Dota 2 from my main Linux drive. If you are reading this you might be having the same issue. I sure hope this fixes the problem you are having.</p>

I transferred the GMK Carbon TKL set to my Quickfire Stealth with green switches and for some reason I am having a hard time typing fast with good accuracy. I can type fast but I observed that I would need to hit the backspace key more often than I should.</p>
<p>I think I am not for this Cherry profile and clicky switches combination. I did not have this issue when I had the set on my QFR with cherry mx blacks. I moved over the Taihao yellow/blue keycaps to my QFR and another strange thing is I am liking it and I like typing on that thing more than the greens with GMK.</p>

<br>

<p>I think I just realized something, I think I am more of a linear type of guy. I noticed during the time I went to buy my Taihao keycaps from a local gaming store they had the IKBC F87 RGB with cherry mx switches on display and I was able to try it out and man was it good. I like typing on that thing soft and the lights. I think I should get a board with Cherry MX Reds.</p>
<p>On a side note I am really getting addicted to this keycaps game and been surfing a lot for available rare keycaps… I just hope I did not dig a hole I cannot get out of but looking at the bright side if you get the keycaps they become more rare and valuable plus the value does not really go down but really goes up not unless ofcourse they manufacture the same color way again but I do not think they will in the near future. I heard SP, GMK or other manufacturer have been all booked probably until December of 2017 so who knows.</p>

<p>I decided to install the GMK Carbon keycaps on my QFR board (the one I repainted a few months back).</p>
<p>For some reason the mods or dark colored caps show up as black in the photos but believe me they are really dark grey with orange legends. And I think orange, grey, blue go together.</p>
<p>The caps did considerably lessen the noise for my MX Blacks (well they were not really noisy to begin with) but because this are thick ABS the sound level actually went down compared to ABS keycaps. I posted a video (check my previous post) on how this board sounds like with OEM QFS ABS keycaps.</p>
<p>All in all I am happy with the puchase </p>
